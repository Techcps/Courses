## **Telephony Conversations Quiz**

1. **Your virtual agent has trouble understanding users. When you check Dialogflow conversation history, the transcripts do not match what the user said. You enable Dialogflow‚Äôs audio export bucket to record some calls that exhibit the issue and notice the speech is clear and understandable. How might you fix this?**  
   - Configure a different Google speech model better suited for my use-case.  
   - Ensure that I collect alpha/numeric sequences (like 12345678 or ABCD1234) through form-filling.  
   - Enable call companions to offer users an alternative input method.  
   - Specify manual speech adaptations for the phrases I want to transcribe correctly.  
   - Check that auto speech adaptation is enabled, then make sure the agent‚Äôs training phrases and entities contain the phrases the users are actually saying.  

2. **Which of the following are returned from the CCAI APIs through the telephony integration‚Äôs gRPC?** (Choose three)  
   - Programmatic events that change the conversation state  
   - Start of speech detection  
   - Session parameters  

3. **Google support asks you to share an audio recording of a problem behavior you‚Äôve reported with your telephony experience. Which of the following considerations should you take:** (Choose two)  
   - Check that the caller and agent audio are in separate files, or separate channels of a stereo audio.  
   - Record calls from your CCAI contact center solution.  

4. **Built-in Dialogflow features like barge-in, speech adaptation, and partial responses ensure consistent experiences regardless of your integration method.**  
   - False  

5. **Which of the following are sent through telephony integration‚Äôs gRPC to the CCAI APIs?** (Choose three)

   - Speech model  

7. **Which of the following features could help reliably authenticate users to your virtual agent?** (Choose three)  
   - I can cross-reference Caller ID with a DTMF-collected pin code  
   - I can use a regexp entity and collect an alpha/numeric ID with required form-filling  
   - I can lookup known users from Caller ID then use Speaker ID to tell me which one is speaking  

8. **When you test your virtual agent through your telephony integration, you experience long periods of silence before hearing a response to your inputs. How might you fix this?** (Choose four)  
   - Specify a different speech model.  
   - Check the performance of my fulfillments‚Äô webhooks.  
   - Enable advanced timeout-based endpointing and increase the sensitivity slider.
