## **Generators quiz**

1. **When configuring a Generator there are some controls that can be used to customize the behavior of the generative responses. What are the controls available to you to customize the generative AI responses?** (Select two options)
   - LLM parameters, such as Temperature, Top P and Top K
   - Text Prompt

2. **With generators, you can make a prompt contextual by marking words as placeholders by adding a $ before the word.

   - Any of the session parameters identified in the Intents

3. **Which two language models can a Generator use to generate code? (Select two options)**  
   - code-bison
   - text-bison

4. **Read the text prompt below and answer the following question. What information would the highlighted $conversation placeholder parse into the prompt? Your goal is to summarize a given conversation between a Human and an AI. Conversation: $conversation{USER:"Human:" AGENT:"AI:"}Human: $last-user-utterance A concise summary of the conversation in 1 or 2 sentences is:**  
   - The conversation between the agent and the user, excluding the very last user utterance.


5. **Generators have a particular set of capabilities that can be utilized by a Dialogflow CX virtual agent in a customer conversation. What are two capabilities of Generators?** (Select two options)
   - Sentiment analysis of customer responses
   - Conversation Summarization

6. **What is the correct syntax for a Generator‚Äôs output parameter?**
   - $request.generative

## **Generative Fallback quiz**

1. **A Dialogflow CX flow has been designed for booking diving trips. A particular page in the flow is configured to assist users with group reservations or full charters, the intent description states: ‚ÄòCurrently you can assist users who are looking for a group reservation or a full charter. Initially collect travel details including departure period, destination, number of guests (min 4 max 15 people), contact details. The destination must be one of the following in the Pacific: Costa Rica, Mexico, Galapagos Islands.‚Äô Which Generative Fallback enablement levels would be triggered if the user tries to book a full charter for 18 people?** (Select two options)
   - The page-level would be triggered as the minimum and maximum number of guests is specified in the intent description. The LLM also uses this description to generate the response.
   - The parameter-level would be triggered as the minimum and maximum number of guests is defined as an entity parameter. The LLM uses the intent description to generate the response.


2. **Generative Fallback is a mechanism for handling points in a conversation with a Dialogflow CX virtual agent, where the user moves away from the intended flow and doesn't trigger another action or flow, known as a No Match error. What kind of user response could invoke a No Match error?** (Select two options)
   - Saying something unexpected
   - An invalid input while form filling

3. **You can add a list of banned phrases for your Generative Fallback response. What happens if a banned phrase has been entered by a user as part of their response?**  
   - A prescribed answer defined in Agent Says will be used to respond.

4. **Which statement is true for Generative Fallback:**  
   - Aim to prevent no-match scenarios by providing good, varied training phrases to your intents.

5. **You have been asked to enable generative responses for no-match events for specific pages, by enabling it in the Agent response section of the event handler. Where would you provide the information for the LLM to reference to generate its response?**
   - Intent description


6. **What is the correct definition of the $route-descriptions prompt placeholder?**
   - The intent descriptions of the active intents.

## **Generative AI for virtual agents quiz**

1. **Which two features are used by Generative AI Agents to provide a response based on your data?** (Select two options)
   - Data stores
   - Large Language Models

2. **Data stores are used to find answers for end-user's questions. A data store can consist of different sources. What types of source data are available for data stores in a Vertex AI Search and Conversation?**
   - Website, structured and unstructured data.

3. **What are two other important and useful features that are part of Generative AI Agents and data stores?** (Select two options)
   - Data store prompt
   - Grounding confidence

4. **Which two statements are true for Generative AI Agents? (Select two options)**  
   - With Hybrid Agents you can use a mix-and-match approach to leverage both intent-based flows and generative AI use cases.
   - Keep what is working well in Dialogflow CX and add generative AI capabilities.

5. **A Virtual Agent uses intent detection to route customer questions to the relevant information. Generative AI capabilities can be added to handle certain intent detection routes. Which aspect of Dialogflow CX Agent intent detection do Generative AI Agents cover?**  
   - State handlers
